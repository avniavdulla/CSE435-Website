        <h1>Project Background</h1>
        <p> Automotive manufacturers are rolling out semi-autonomous features to deliver convenience,
            efficiency, and enhanced safety features for vehicles. Features can be classified at
            different levels of automation. Recently, several automotive manufacturers have introduced level 2
            or “hands off”driving features. Although this level is considered hands off, drivers must be prepared
            to resume control of the vehicle. The objective of this project is to develop a system that is capable of
            hands-free highway driving. The system will allow drivers to enable a hands-free assisted driving feature
            which will drive the vehicle in its existing lane without needing to control the steering wheel.</p>

        <h1>Project Description</h1>
        <p>The HFDS system allows a vehicle to automatically steer, accelerate and brake in
            certain highway conditions. Once activated, the driver can remove their hands from the wheel
            and is continuously monitored to ensure active engagement with the road. Warnings are issued if 1)
            the system needs the driver to reclaim control, 2) The driver is deemed distracted.</p>

        <p> The driver must first be driving on a highway that has been enabled by the Path Prediction Subsystem.
            The Driver Assist System validates road conditions, current trajectory, sensor input, and predicted path.
            If the current trajectory is deemed safe, the user can opt to enter hands-free mode. Once engaged,
            the user can remove their hands from the steering wheel.
            The vehicle will enter an adaptive cruise control state and stay within
            its existing lane for the duration of the session.</p>

        <p>When engaged, the Driver Attention System monitors the driver’s eyes and head
            movements to ensure proper engagement with the road. Camera monitoring should work in
            all lighting conditions. The system can identify if the driver is not properly engaged
            the road. If this occurs, various warnings are issued to the driver. A final warning will
            send vibrations to the driver to reengage. If the system identifies the driver as inactive,
            the system aborts hands-free mode and if needed, the vehicle will come to a stop. Besides
            attentive eyes and head placement, driver interaction is not required. However,
            the driver can intervene and regain control of the vehicle by either controlling the
            steering wheel, braking, or throttle.</p>
